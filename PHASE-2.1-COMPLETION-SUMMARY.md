---

## What Was Built

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Database Schema
**File**: `backend/src/migrations/1763106385357-CreatePaymentsTable.ts`
- Created `payments` table with complete schema
- Foreign keys to `orders` and `businesses` (CASCADE delete)
- Unique constraint on `stripe_payment_intent_id`
- 4 optimized indexes (order_id, business_id, status, created_at)
- Support for refunds, partial payments, and metadata

**Fields**:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `order_id` (UUID, foreign key)
- `business_id` (UUID, foreign key)
- `stripe_payment_intent_id` (unique)
- `stripe_charge_id`
- `amount_cents` (integer)
- `currency` (VARCHAR, default 'INR')
- `status` (pending, succeeded, failed, canceled, refunded)
- `payment_method` (card, upi, etc.)
- `failure_reason` (text)
- `metadata` (JSONB)
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

#### 2. Payment Model
**File**: `backend/src/models/Payment.ts`
- TypeORM entity with full type safety
- Relations to Order and Business models
- PaymentStatus type definition
- Auto-generated timestamps

#### 3. Stripe Service
**File**: `backend/src/services/StripeService.ts` (420 lines)

**Key Methods**:
- `createPaymentIntent()` - Create payment intent for order
- `handleWebhook()` - Process Stripe webhook events
- `handlePaymentSucceeded()` - Update order on successful payment
- `handlePaymentFailed()` - Track failed payments

- `handleChargeRefunded()` - Process refunds
- `getPaymentByOrderId()` - Retrieve payment by order
- `retrievePaymentIntent()` - Get payment intent from Stripe
- `createRefund()` - Create full or partial refund
- `getBusinessPaymentStats()` - Analytics (total revenue, success rate, etc.)

**Features**:
- Automatic payment methods enabled (cards, wallets)
- Custom statement descriptors
- Metadata support for tracking
- Error handling with custom error types
- Metric logging for production monitoring

#### 4. Payment API Routes
**File**: `backend/src/routes/payments.ts`

**Endpoints**:
1. `POST /payments/create-intent` - Public endpoint for creating payment intent
   - Validates order exists
   - Checks for duplicate payments
   - Returns client secret for frontend

2. `POST /payments/webhook` - Stripe webhook handler
   - Signature verification
   - Event processing (succeeded, failed, canceled, refunded)

5. `GET /payments/business/:businessId/stats` - Payment analytics (authenticated)
   - Date range filtering
   - Total payments, successful, failed
   - Total revenue, average order value

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Stripe Provider
**File**: `frontend/src/components/payments/StripeProvider.tsx`
- Wraps app with Stripe Elements context
- Lazy-loads Stripe.js for performance
- Environment variable validation
- Graceful fallback if Stripe not configured

#### 2. Payment Modal
**File**: `frontend/src/components/payments/PaymentModal.tsx`

- `createPaymentIntent(orderId)` - Create payment intent
- `getPaymentById(paymentId)` - Get payment details
- `createRefund(paymentId, options)` - Create refund
- `getBusinessPaymentStats(businessId, filters)` - Get analytics

#### 5. Public Menu Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/PublicMenuPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added payment modal state management
- Modified checkout flow:
  - If payment method = "online" → Show payment modal
  - If payment method = "cash/card" → Complete order immediately
- Payment success/cancel handlers
- Order creation before payment
- Cart clearing after successful payment

#### 6. Configuration
**File**: `frontend/.env.example`
- Added `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**File**: `frontend/package.json`
- Installed `@stripe/stripe-js` (^4.x)
- Installed `@stripe/react-stripe-js` (^2.x)

## API Endpoints Summary

### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/payments/create-intent` - Create payment intent
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook` - Stripe webhook handler

### Authenticated Endpoints (Seller)
- `GET /api/v1/payments/:id` - Get payment details
- `POST /api/v1/payments/:id/refund` - Create refund
- `GET /api/v1/payments/business/:businessId/stats` - Payment statistics

---

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)
```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1
```

---

## Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production:

1. **Replace test keys with live keys**
   - Backend: `sk_live_...`
   - Frontend: `pk_live_...`
   - Webhook: Set up production endpoint

2. **Configure webhook endpoint**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/payments/webhook`
   - Events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_failed, canceled, charge.refunded

3. **Set up monitoring**
   - Payment success rate alerts
   - Failed payment notifications
   - Webhook delivery monitoring

4. **Security checklist**
   - Verify HTTPS enabled
   - Test webhook signature verification
   - Review CORS settings
   - Enable Stripe Radar (fraud detection)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single payment per order** - Currently supports one payment intent per order
2. **Manual payouts** - Seller payouts are tracked but not automated (Phase 3 feature)
3. **No saved cards** - Customers must enter card each time (Phase 2.6 feature)
4. **Limited currencies** - Defaults to INR (configurable per business)
5. **No payment links** - Direct payment flow only (not shareable links)

These are acceptable for Phase 2.1 and will be addressed in future phases.

---

## Metrics to Monitor

Once deployed, monitor:

- **Payment success rate** - Target: > 98%
- **Average payment time** - Target: < 10 seconds
- **Failed payment reasons** - Identify patterns
- **Refund rate** - Target: < 5%
- **Customer complaints** - Payment-related issues
- **Webhook delivery rate** - Target: > 99.9%

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2.1 (Stripe Payment Integration) is COMPLETE** ✅

All deliverables met:
- ✅ Backend payment processing
- ✅ Frontend payment UI
- ✅ Webhook handling
- ✅ Refund support
- ✅ Payment analytics
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Test mode validated

The payment system is production-ready and can be deployed immediately after:
1. Setting up live Stripe account
2. Configuring production webhook
3. Running final QA tests

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2.2: Tiered Subscriptions** 🚀
