  async getDashboardMetrics(sellerId: string, period: 'day' | 'week' | 'month') {
    // Real-time metrics with caching
  }

  async getCustomerInsights(sellerId: string) {
    // Customer segments, CLV, churn prediction
  }

  async getMenuRecommendations(sellerId: string) {
    // ML-based dish recommendations
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Inventory Management (Priority: Medium)

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### 1. Database Optimizations

**Current State**: Using TypeORM `synchronize` mode (development only)

**Production Recommendation**:
- [ ] Generate migrations from entities:
  ```bash
  npm run migration:generate -- -n InitialSchema
  ```
- [ ] Switch to migration-based deployments (`synchronize: false`)
- [ ] Add database indices for performance:
  - `orders.created_at` (frequent queries)
  - `businesses.slug` (public menu lookups)
  - `dishes.business_id` (seller's dish list)
  - `coupons.code` (coupon validation)
- [ ] Implement database sharding (if > 10M records)
  - Shard by `business_id` (horizontal partitioning)

---

### 2. Caching Strategy

**Current State**: No caching layer

**Recommendations**:
- [ ] Implement Redis caching:
  - Marketplace search results (cache 5 min)
  - Public menu pages (cache 1 hour)
  - User sessions (JWT alternative)
  - Rate limiting counters
- [ ] CDN caching for static assets (CloudFront, Cloudflare)
- [ ] Browser caching headers (aggressive for images, conservative for HTML)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

async function getCachedMenu(businessSlug: string) {
  const cached = await redis.get(`menu:${businessSlug}`);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  const menu = await fetchMenuFromDatabase(businessSlug);
  await redis.setex(`menu:${businessSlug}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(menu));
  return menu;
}
```

---

### 3. API Performance Optimizations

**Current Issues**:
- N+1 query problem (loading related entities)
- Large payload sizes (entire entities returned)
- No pagination on list endpoints

**Fixes**:
- [ ] Use TypeORM `relations` with `select` to avoid N+1:
  ```typescript
  await this.orderRepository.find({
    where: { business_id: businessId },
    relations: ['items', 'items.dish'],
    select: ['id', 'total_cents', 'status'], // Only needed fields
  });
  ```
- [ ] Implement pagination:
  ```typescript
  const [orders, total] = await this.orderRepository.findAndCount({
    skip: (page - 1) * limit,
    take: limit,
    order: { created_at: 'DESC' },
  });
  ```
- [ ] Add field selection (GraphQL-style):
  ```typescript
  GET /api/v1/orders?fields=id,total_cents,status
  ```

---

### 4. Security Enhancements

**High Priority**:
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Prevent XSS attacks
  - Restrict script sources

- [ ] Rate limiting per user (not just IP)
  - 100 requests/min per authenticated user
  - 10 requests/min for login attempts
- [ ] PII encryption at rest
  - Encrypt `phone_number`, `email` in database
  - Use AWS KMS or similar

**Medium Priority**:
- [ ] Input sanitization (prevent script injection in dish names)
- [ ] File upload validation (restrict to images, max 5MB)
- [ ] Brute-force protection on login (account lockout after 5 failed attempts)
- [ ] Secrets rotation (rotate JWT secret monthly)

---

### 5. Code Quality Improvements

**Linting & Formatting**:
- [ ] Enable stricter ESLint rules
- [ ] Add Prettier pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
- [ ] Add TypeScript no-any rule enforcement
