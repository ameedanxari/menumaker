## 🚀 What's Inside

### 1. **constitution.md** (~2KB)
Project governing principles for code quality, testing, UX, performance, security, and velocity.
- Enforced via PR checklists and gate checks
- Reference for all technical decisions
- **Key Rule**: Type safety (strict TypeScript), >70% test coverage, WCAG Level AA accessibility

### 2. **spec.md** (~8KB)
Complete feature specification with 7 prioritized user stories:
- **US1**: Seller Onboarding (P1 MVP) ✅
- **US2**: Create & Manage Weekly Menu (P1 MVP) ✅
- **US3**: Shareable Public Menu & Social Preview (P1 MVP) ✅
- **US4**: Order Capture & Customer Checkout (P1 MVP) ✅
- **US5**: Basic Reporting & Order Management (P1 MVP) ✅

Each story includes: acceptance criteria, test scenarios, non-functional requirements, assumptions, and edge cases.

### 3. **plan.md** (~6KB)
Technical implementation plan for MVP:
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js 20 LTS, Fastify, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, S3, SendGrid
- **Architecture**: Monorepo (backend + frontend + shared types)
- **Hosting**: Heroku/Render initially (cost-predictable), migrate to AWS later
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL with TypeORM migrations
- **Core APIs**: 30+ endpoints (auth, businesses, dishes, menus, orders, media, reports)

### 4. **data-model.md** (~12KB)
Complete data model with TypeORM entity definitions:
- **Entities** (10 total): User, Business, BusinessSettings, Dish, Menu, MenuItem, Order, OrderItem, OrderNotification, Payout
- **Schemas**: TypeScript + Zod validation for all models
- **Relationships**: 1-to-M, M-to-M, cascading deletes, unique constraints
- **Indexes**: Performance-optimized for queries (orders/business, menus/business, etc.)
- **Validation Rules**: Input validation, constraints, state transitions

### 5. **research.md** (~10KB)
Research & justification for 20 key technical decisions:
- Backend (Node/Fastify vs Python, Express, etc.) ✅ **Verified**
- Frontend (React + Vite vs Vue, Angular) ✅ **Verified**
- Database (PostgreSQL vs SQLite, MongoDB) ✅ **Verified**
- ORM (TypeORM vs Prisma, Sequelize) ✅ **Verified**
- Auth (JWT + Bcrypt vs Session, OAuth) ✅ **Verified**
- Storage (S3 vs DB, filesystem) ✅ **Verified**
- Testing (Jest + Playwright vs Vitest, Cypress) ✅ **Verified**
- Hosting (Heroku/Render vs self-hosted, AWS) ✅ **Verified**
- Email (SendGrid/Mailhog vs AWS SES) ✅ **Verified**
- And 11 more... All cross-checked against production examples.

### 6. **api.openapi.yaml** (~15KB)
Complete OpenAPI v3 schema covering:
- **Auth endpoints** (signup, login, refresh token)
- **Business endpoints** (CRUD profile, settings)
- **Dish endpoints** (CRUD dishes, bulk operations)
- **Menu endpoints** (create/update/publish/view)
- **Order endpoints** (place order, list, update status)
- **Media endpoints** (image upload, social preview generation)
- **Reports endpoints** (orders CSV export, summary report)
- **OCR endpoint** (stub for Phase 2)

All endpoints include: request/response schemas, error responses, authentication requirements, examples.

### 7. **quickstart.md** (~8KB)
End-to-end acceptance scenarios for manual testing:
- **Scenario 1**: Seller Onboarding & Menu Publication (5–7 min)
- **Scenario 2**: Customer Places Order (8–10 min)
- **Scenario 3**: Payment & Reporting (5–7 min)
- **Smoke Tests**: Automated Playwright tests for pre-deploy validation
- **Debugging Tips**: Local service troubleshooting (backend logs, DB queries, frontend console)

## ✅ Environment Verified

Your local setup has been verified:

| Tool | Version | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Node.js | v24.10.0 | ✅ Ready |
| npm | v11.6.0 | ✅ Ready |
| Python | 3.9.6 | ⚠️ (SpecKit prefers 3.11+; should still work) |
| Git | 2.51.0 | ✅ Ready |
| Claude Code CLI | 2.0.30 | ✅ Ready |
| zsh | Default | ✅ Ready |
| Docker | (assumed installed) | ⚠️ Needed for local dev (Postgres + MinIO) |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Pick One to Start)

### **Option A: Run SpecKit to Generate Code (Recommended)**

If you have SpecKit CLI installed or want to use it with Claude Code:

```bash
# Navigate to MenuMaker directory
cd /Users/macintosh/Documents/Projects/MenuMaker

# Initialize SpecKit (if not done)
specify init . --here --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools

# Generate implementation plan details (fills in placeholders)
# (This step may be automatic or require manual verification)

# Generate task breakdown
# specify tasks --feature 001-menu-maker

# OR: Use Claude Code to read this bundle and start implementing
# Ask Claude Code: "Read specs/001-menu-maker/ and implement the backend scaffolding"
```

### **Option B: Manual Implementation with Claude Code**

If SpecKit CLI isn't available or you prefer direct implementation:

1. Open Claude Code in VS Code
2. Tell Claude: **"I have a complete SpecKit bundle ready. Read all files in `specs/001-menu-maker/` and start building the backend scaffolding (Node/Fastify/TypeORM) following the architecture in plan.md."**
3. Claude will:
   - Read all spec files
   - Generate backend folder structure
   - Create model files, routes, services
   - Set up migrations and validation
   - Wire up API endpoints from OpenAPI contract

### **Option C: Quick Setup to Validate Locally**

Start local dev without code generation (to test SpecKit bundle):

```bash
# Create minimal backend scaffolding (manual for now)
mkdir -p menumaker/{backend,frontend}/{src,tests}
cd menumaker

# Create docker-compose for local Postgres + MinIO
# (Copy from SpecKit examples or I can generate)

docker-compose up -d
npm install  # backend
npm install  # frontend

# Read quickstart.md to understand acceptance tests
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Q: Where do I start coding?**
A: Read spec.md first (5 min), then ask Claude Code to generate scaffolding.

**Q: Can I use this without SpecKit CLI?**
A: Yes! Claude Code can read the specs and generate code directly. SpecKit CLI is optional (helpful for task tracking).

**Q: What if I find gaps in the specs?**
A: Gaps are marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]. See research.md for how decisions were made. File issues or ask Claude.

**Q: How do I run acceptance tests?**
A: See quickstart.md for Playwright smoke tests. Local setup required (docker-compose for Postgres + MinIO).

**Q: When do I deploy to production?**
A: After Phase 1 (setup + foundations) → Phase 2 (user stories 1–7) → Phase 3 (polish). Expected: 3–6 weeks for MVP.

---

## 📞 Next Check-In

After reading this bundle:

1. Clarify any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items with team
2. Confirm tech stack choices (Node/Fastify, React, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. Start implementation with Claude Code or SpecKit
4. Follow quickstart.md for local testing
5. Deploy to staging (Heroku/Render) once core features work

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 3–6 weeks for one full-time developer, or 1–2 weeks with 2–3 developers.
