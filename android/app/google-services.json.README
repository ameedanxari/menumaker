# google-services.json - Dummy File for Testing

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is a DUMMY Firebase configuration file for testing and CI/CD purposes only.

## Purpose
This file allows the Android app to build and run tests without requiring a real Firebase project.
It contains fake API keys and project IDs that will NOT work with actual Firebase services.

## For Production
To use real Firebase services (push notifications, analytics, etc.):

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Add your Android app with package name: `com.menumaker`
3. Download the real `google-services.json` file
4. Replace this dummy file with the real one
5. **NEVER commit the real file to version control** (it's in .gitignore)

## For Development/Testing
The dummy file is sufficient for:
- Running unit tests
- Running instrumented tests
- Building debug APKs
- CI/CD pipelines

## Credentials in This File
All values in this file are FAKE and safe to commit:
- Project ID: menumaker-test (doesn't exist)
- API Key: AIzaSyDummyKeyForTestingPurposesOnly123456 (invalid)
- App ID: 1:123456789000:android:abcdef1234567890 (fake)

These values satisfy the Google Services plugin requirements but won't connect to real services.
