# AI Prompt Library — Steering

Auto-deployed to IDE steering directories (`.kiro/steering/`, `.cursor/rules/`,
`.windsurf/rules/`, `.vscode/ai-steering/`, `.ai-steering/`, `.continue/rules/`).
Loaded by the IDE at every session. Keep it short.

## The flow (for non-trivial or resume requests)

1. Read `.ai-prompts/prompts/orchestrators/ai-agent-entry-point.md` first. That's the only orchestrator that auto-loads at startup; the engine for the chosen mode loads after routing.
2. **Continue / Resume:** the entry point picks ONE path in order:
   - **Checkpoint:** if `resumption-checkpoint.md` exists, load ONLY files under `re_load_files` (~85% token savings).
   - **Execution fast path:** if checkpoint is missing but `execution-log.md` has a non-null `next_task`, skip planning re-reads and route directly to `executor.md`.
   - **Force-reload:** only when both above are unavailable, or the user explicitly asks to "rebuild" / "force reload" / "re-read all" / "refresh context". Re-read all planning artifacts, then write a fresh checkpoint.
   - **Ambiguous-resumption error:** if the prompt is a bare resumption verb (`continue`, `proceed`, `next`, `resume`, etc.) AND no checkpoint AND no in-flight execution-log, fail fast and ask the user to use the long-form resumption prompt or describe new work. Do not introspect on "is this a new chat?" — use disk facts only.
3. The entry point chooses one of four modes and then loads the matching engine:
   - **Trivial** (single-file edit) → skip engines, just do the work.
   - **Execute** (a validated plan exists and user says fix/implement/
     do-the-work) → loads `executor.md`.
   - **Gap-closure** (existing codebase; user asks to review, audit,
     fix gaps, productionize, write tests, finish) →
     loads `audit-and-remediate.md`. Stops after the planning revise gate
     for user review before execution.
   - **Greenfield** (new project) → loads `drill-down-engine.md`.
4. If external material exists (designs/specs/source code under
   `working_copy/`, `prompts/working_copy/`, or project has real
   `src/`/`backend/`/`frontend/`/`android/`/`ios/` directories), also
   read `.ai-prompts/prompts/orchestrators/external-input-handler.md`.
5. Follow the chosen engine until its next checkpoint. Stop at every
   checkpoint and wait for `Continue`.

## Progress-checklist guard — don't advance stages on memory

When an engine stage produces many files (Step 3 generates one
`tasks-<feature>.md` per declared feature; on a real project that's
often 100+), run the progress script between task files:

```bash
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/step3-progress.sh prompts/outputs/current
```

The script lists every declared feature with `- [x]` (tasks file on
disk) or `- [ ]` (still needed). Do NOT advance to the next stage
while any `- [ ]` remains. Do NOT track completion in memory — the
script is the source of truth.

## Finalize — the ONLY way to say "Step 3 is complete"

When you believe all `tasks-*.md` files are written, run this **exact
one command** before telling the user you are done:

```bash
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/finalize.sh prompts/outputs/current
```

It chains the mechanical auto-fixers, runs the Revise Gate, writes a
canonical `revise-report.md`, and prints `executor_gate: pass` or
`fail`. You are NOT allowed to declare the drill-down complete unless
the last line printed is `✅ executor_gate: pass`. If it prints `fail`,
open `revise-report.md`, regenerate each file listed in
`failing_files:` via the engine (one feature at a time, never
hand-edit), and re-run `finalize.sh`.

Never hand-write `revise-report.md` — it is machine-produced and
tamper-checked (`revised_at` freshness + non-empty check arrays).

## Mechanical helpers (called by finalize.sh, can also be run alone)

```bash
# Missing comma before "so that" in Closes-user-story lines.
# (Invoked automatically by finalize.sh.)
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/fix-user-stories.sh prompts/outputs/current

# App-store screenshot matrix (15+ capture tasks per platform).
# Generates tasks-screenshots-<platform>.md with 2 tooling tasks +
# N locales × M devices capture tasks pre-filled with the canonical
# schema. You only fill in the UITest class / method per frame.
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/scaffold-screenshot-captures.sh \
    --target prompts/outputs/current --platform ios --app-name <Name>
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/scaffold-screenshot-captures.sh \
    --target prompts/outputs/current --platform android --app-name <Name>
```

After running any helper, re-run `finalize.sh` to refresh the gate.

## Harness-crash + auto-commit pipelines (executor-only)

The executor (`.ai-prompts/prompts/orchestrators/executor.md`) wires
two pipelines that happy-path planning sessions do NOT need to load:

- **On every test/build failure:** `scripts/diagnose-harness.sh`
  classifies the failure (`harness_crash` / `code_crash_known` /
  `code_crash_unknown` / `not_crashed`) using per-stack catalogs
  under `.ai-prompts/prompts/modules/harness-recovery/`. Recipes
  recover the harness automatically; structured `code_fix`
  remediations are applied by the AI executor in the next loop iteration.
- **On every successful task:** `scripts/safety-check-commit.sh` +
  `scripts/commit-task.sh` produce one commit per task with scope
  and revert-protection invariants. Push is never automatic at the
  task level.

If you are routing into Mode 1 (trivial), Mode 3/4 (planning), or
running pure planning steps, do not pre-load any of these — the
executor loads them on demand.

## Execute-signal guard — only after a plan exists

If a validated plan already exists and the user's prompt contains any
of these words (case-insensitive), they have authorised execution:

> **fix · implement · execute · run · do the work · build · ship ·
> close the gaps · write the tests · make it pass · productionize ·
> deploy-ready · review AND fix · audit AND fix**

When that is true, **do not** produce a message that ends with
a menu like:

> _Would you like me to: A. Execute critical gaps, B. Execute all, C. …_

That menu pattern is **forbidden** for an already-validated plan. Start
the execution loop per `executor.md`.

During greenfield or gap-closure planning, execute-signal words in the
original prompt do not bypass checkpoints or the final planning hard
stop. The user reviews the generated plan before executor handoff.

You may stop execution and report to the user only when:
- A hard preflight / validator gate fails (mechanical block).
- A task returns a real-world blocker (missing credentials, missing
  upstream API, test environment unavailable) — log it in
  `execution-log.md` as `blocked` and move on to the next.
- The executor's own stop rules fire (3+ consecutive blockers, a
  broader regression, user interrupt).

Politeness is not grounds to stop. The user already gave consent.

## IDE-native spec kits

Do NOT use Kiro's `.kiro/specs/`, Cursor's `.cursor/plans/`, or any
other IDE-native spec workflow in place of the library's engines. Our
outputs are richer and verifiable. Write to `prompts/outputs/current/`
regardless of which IDE is running.

## Reset signal

If the user asks to "reset", "re-integrate", "start fresh", OR the project
root contains `NEXT_ACTION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`,
`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `QUICK_STATUS.md`, or any stale `AGENTS.md`
referencing `execution-orchestrator.md` / `auto-request-router.md` /
`stage-pipeline-orchestrator.md`, run this first:

```bash
bash .ai-prompts/scripts/reset-integration.sh --yes
```

## Do NOT auto-load

- Any orchestrator under `.ai-prompts/prompts/orchestrators/` without
  following the entry-point routing.
- `.ai-prompts/docs/optional/` — safeguard docs, on-demand only.
- The full module catalog — the engine loads one module at a time during expansion.

## Authority

`.ai-prompts/prompts/AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth. If anything
in this file drifts from it, `AGENTS.md` wins.
